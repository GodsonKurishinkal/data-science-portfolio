## 🎯 What Was Updated

Successfully showcased **Phase 4: Demand Response Modeling** on your portfolio website!

### 📊 Homepage Changes

**Before:**
- Badge: "🚀 In Progress"
- Stats: 3,000+ lines, 36 tests
- Description: Generic "demand forecasting"

**After:**
- Badge: "🚀 Phase 4 Complete"
- Stats: **4,500+ lines**, **54 tests passing**
- Description: Specific "demand response modeling, seasonality, promotional effects"

### 📄 Dynamic Pricing Project Page

**New Phase 4 Section Added:**

✅ **Complete Status Badge** - Shows Phase 4 is finished (Nov 11, 2025)

✅ **Comprehensive Features List:**
- Demand prediction formula: Q_new = Q_base × (P_new/P_base)^elasticity × seasonality × promotion
- Demand curve generation (30 price points)
- Seasonality modeling (day-of-week, monthly, weekend)
- Promotional lift effects (BOGO, discount, bundle, clearance)
- Bulk operations for multiple products
- 95% confidence intervals
- Scenario analysis (9+ strategies)

✅ **Demo Results:**
- Optimal price: +30% from baseline → +$330 revenue
- Best scenario: +20% price → +20% revenue (inelastic products)
- Weekend demand: 1.1% lower than weekdays
- Promotional lift: 30% demand increase

✅ **Technical Stats:**
- 600+ lines of production code
- 18 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
- Full demo script with 9-step workflow

✅ **New Code Examples:**
```python
# Demand prediction at price point
result = model.predict_demand_at_price(...)

# Generate demand curve
curve = model.predict_demand_curve(...)

# Find optimal price
optimal = curve[curve['is_optimal']]
```
